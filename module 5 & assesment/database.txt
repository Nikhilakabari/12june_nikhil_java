Q3
Data Structure:

DBMS: A DBMS is a software system that allows for the creation, retrieval, storage, and management of data.
RDBMS: An RDBMS is a specific type of DBMS that is based on the relational model of data. 


Data Integrity:
DBMS: DBMS systems may or may not enforce data integrity rules, such as constraints and relationships, depending on the specific system.
RDBMS: RDBMS systems are designed with a strong focus on data integrity. They enforce data constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).

Query Language:
DBMS: Generic DBMS systems may offer their own query languages or support SQL
RDBMS: RDBMS systems typically have robust support for SQL, a standardized and powerful query language for managing relational data. 

Q4
Codd's rule in DBMS also known as Codd's 12 rules/commandments is a set of thirteen rules (numbered 0 to 12) that define a database to be a correct Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). If a database follows Codd's 12 rules, it is called a True relational database management system.

Q5
Data redundancy refers to the duplication of data within a database or information system

Q6
 DDL (Data Definition Language) interpreter is a component of a database management system (DBMS) responsible for processing and executing DDL statements. DDL is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define, modify, and manage the structure 

Q8
SQL key constraints are rules or conditions that define the uniqueness and relationships of data in database tables

primary key
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);


Q9
A savepoint in a database management system (DBMS) is a named point in a transaction to which you can later roll back if needed.

Q10
A trigger in SQL is a set of instructions or code that is automatically executed in response to a specific event or action that occurs in a database table. 

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
    -- Trigger code or statements
END;
